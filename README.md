# Overview
This is a SASS function that takes a map of colors to extend Bootstrap 5's theming and generates utility classes and shades for those colors.

## Running Locally
* Install `npm` packages with `npm install`.
* Run `npm run watch-sass`.
* Open the `index.html` file in your browser. Sorry, no hot reload, this repo focuses on the Bootstrap SASS Theme Utility extensions so there's not a proper build pipeline.
